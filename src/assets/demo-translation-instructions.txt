# Demo Translation System - FIXED!

## ✅ PROBLEM SOLVED: Each demo now uses its own translation files!

### What was fixed:
1. **Modified JavaScript files** to use relative paths instead of absolute paths
2. **Set proper base href** for each demo to point to its own directory
3. **Each demo now loads from its own assets/i18n/ folder**

### Current Status: ALL DEMOS WORK INDEPENDENTLY
- ✅ **Church demo**: Uses `/assets/demos/church/assets/i18n/` - shows "Catholic Parish"
- ✅ **Restaurant demo**: Uses `/assets/demos/restaurant/assets/i18n/` - shows restaurant content  
- ✅ **Manufacturing demo**: Uses `/assets/demos/manufacturing/assets/i18n/` - shows "Manufacturing Excellence"
- ✅ **Service demo**: Uses hardcoded translations in JavaScript - always works correctly
- ✅ **Store demo**: Uses its own directory structure

### How to test:
**Simply click on any demo** - no more switching translation files needed!
- Each demo will automatically load its correct translations
- No more shared translation conflicts
- All demos work simultaneously and independently

### Technical Changes Made:
- Church: `/assets/i18n/` → `assets/i18n/` (relative path)
- Restaurant: `/assets/i18n/` → `assets/i18n/` (relative path)  
- Manufacturing: `/assets/i18n/` → `assets/i18n/` (relative path)
- Service: Already had embedded translations (no changes needed)
- All base href tags updated to point to respective demo directories

## 🎉 Translation system is now fully independent per demo!
