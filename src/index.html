FILE: /c:/local/angulardev/mywebsite/src/index.html

DESCRIPTION:
This is the main HTML entry point for the Angular application. It serves as the root document
that loads the Angular application and its dependencies. This file is typically served by the
web server and processed by the Angular framework to bootstrap the application.

PURPOSE:
- Defines the HTML5 document structure for the application
- Contains the root app component where Angular mounts the application
- Includes meta tags for browser compatibility and responsive design
- Links to external stylesheets and resources
- May include inline scripts or references to bundled JavaScript files

USAGE:
This file is automatically processed during the Angular build process and should not be
modified directly unless adding global meta tags, external scripts, or base HTML structure
changes that apply to the entire application.
